# 2020

* Make PlotFrame.clear_axes() -> as (see hitopop)
* Make more verbose pick_many, actually, how does that work

# UI

* color text of matplotlib according to scheme
* make sahs working on left pane hide
  * Repair Imageparameters (colo stuff) 
  * The sash toggle does not work properly, see in TextFrame
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop


# Always possible

* Better documentation
* More colorscheme and better interface to choose
* Better preference saving, loading
  * Appdir module
  * In util, parse_argument and restart
