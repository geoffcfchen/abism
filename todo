# Always possible

  * Beware the magic (FrameText 22, xtermTk, fontsize)
  * Consistent naming
* Matplotlib super keyboard navigation (did not manage today to get key event only in my frame)
* Feature: show bad pixels: can be usefull for an observatro (example if object is on it: change telescope orientation)
