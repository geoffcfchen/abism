* Sky: see how is is estimated annulus and 8rect, because it must be feeded to fit but depends on fit

# Latter

# Refactor

* root_window containt and not extend a tk_Tk (better for ipy)
  * Warning, some get_root().bind_all need it to bee the oldest ancestor

* SthrelImage discirminator: Sthrel is just a wrapper, join them ?

## Latter feature

* Add fit param button only if fit param are present (see ellipse)
  * Ellipse pick answer should delete fit param: I may give stat in place
* 5h Get error for all answer, append them at the same time
* 3h Argument parsing, link with AbismState
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop
* 1h Ellipse  (refactor in plugin)
* 2h Datacube if more than 3 dimension
* 2h TightBinary
  * Anisoplanetism = false: otherwise more degenerated, or think of it, give user the choice
* Have a glimps at first guess which is really really important, especially for moffat


### Latter fix
* More options, test my stuff (also on binary)

### Latter refactor
* frame_text, optionFrame many function, create subclass like optionElement
* frame_text, base class has getten big

# Always possible
