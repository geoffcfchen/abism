# 2020

* Make PlotFrame.clear_axes() -> as (see hitopop)
* Make more verbose pick_many, actually, how does that work

# UI

* make sahs working on left pane hide
  * Repair Imageparameters (color stuff) 
  * The sash toggle does not work properly, see in TextFrame
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop
* Matplotlib, get better zoom


# Always possible

* Better documentation
* More colorscheme and better interface to choose
* Better preference saving, loading
  * Appdir module
  * In util, parse_argument and restart
* Clean code (especially backend)
  * Beware the magic (FrameText 22, xtermTk, fontsize)
  * Consistent naming
