# Latter
################################################################################

## Latter feature
* Datacube if more than 3 dimension
* Argument parsing, link with AbismState
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop

### Latter fix
* !!! Bad pixels !! You cannot release putting them to zero
* More options, test my stuff
* Destroy cleanly, no matplotlib error should trigger

### Latter refactor
* frame_text, optionFrame many function, create subclass like optionElement
* frame_tex, base class has getten big

# Always possible
################################################################################

* Better documentation
* More colorscheme and better interface to choose
* Better preference saving, loading
  * Appdir module
  * In util, parse_argument and restart
* Clean code (especially backend)
  * Beware the magic (FrameText 22, xtermTk, fontsize)
  * Consistent naming
* Matplotlib super keyboard navigation (did not manage today to get key event only in my frame)
* Feature: show bad pixels: can be usefull for an observatro (example if object is on it: change telescope orientation)
* UI: Add some colorscheme (material)
