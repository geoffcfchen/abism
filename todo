  * First create legacy button
* Repair toSky -> toDetector


# UI

* Skin: create entry and checkbutton (see readheader and analysis check button, l122)
* Stat: optimize, lazy and max one calculation (but image may have changed with background removal
* Argument parsing, link with AbismState
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop
* make sahs of left pane, better move when adding or removeing frames
* More options, test my stuff
* PlotStat dans AnswerReturn 520, make it in answer frame and not plot
* ImageFrame: clean : remove old parameters and replce what nee by self
  * Make cube work again (with some self.variable in (frame plot .py)


# Always possible

* Better documentation
* More colorscheme and better interface to choose
* Better preference saving, loading
  * Appdir module
  * In util, parse_argument and restart
* Clean code (especially backend)
  * Beware the magic (FrameText 22, xtermTk, fontsize)
  * Consistent naming
* Matplotlib super keyboard navigation (did not manage today to get key event only in my frame)
