1. Refactor: AnswerReturn and Pick  (then every oth todo will be easyier)
  * Add other info to Text
  * PlotStat dans AnswerReturn 520, make it in answer frame and not plot
  * Get Ellipse in legacy
    * First create legacy button
    * And make ellipse work
    * 


* Photometric error where are you ? 

# Bug

* Manual photometry not working

# UI

* Skin: create entrybutton, and checkbutton (because cannto see in dark)

# Easy win

* Move Profile in analisys

# Refactor

* Read_Header to back (see deps_2.png)
* frame_plot and frem_text perfect (no G)
* SthrelImage discirminator: Sthrel is just a wrapper, join them ?
* frame_tex, base class has getten big
* put image info in abism state (and not root) 

# Latter

* !!! Bad pixels !! You cannot release putting them to zero
* Datacube if more than 3 dimension
* Argument parsing, link with AbismState
* (Hard 5h) Embed jupyter client to speak to a kernel in tk loop
* More options, test my stuff
* Destroy cleanly, no matplotlib error should trigger
* frame_text, optionFrame many function, create subclass like optionElement

# Always possible

* Better documentation
* More colorscheme and better interface to choose
* Better preference saving, loading
  * Appdir module
  * In util, parse_argument and restart
* Clean code (especially backend)
  * Beware the magic (FrameText 22, xtermTk, fontsize)
  * Consistent naming
* Matplotlib super keyboard navigation (did not manage today to get key event only in my frame)
* Feature: show bad pixels: can be usefull for an observatro (example if object is on it: change telescope orientation)
