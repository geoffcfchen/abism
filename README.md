# ABISM : Adaptive Background Interferometric Strehl Meter

__What:__
A graphical user interface (GUI) to measure the strehl ratio.
Meaning the quality (.fits) image from a telescope with adaptive optics.


__Who:__
For observer astronomers using adaptive optics

__How:__

On the following image, we have a Strehl ratio 50% which is excellent.
Notice the warning that we are reaching the non-linearity detector limit.
We did not take time to measure the error of the measure if non linear, it is very detector dependant.
